1. Planning:
Problem: Users need a simple way to manage daily tasks.
Goal: Create a To-Do List app to add, complete, and delete tasks.
2. Requirements Analysis:
Functional: Add tasks, delete tasks, mark complete, show warnings.
Non-Functional: Easy to use, responsive, lightweight.
3. Design:
GUI using Tkinter (Label, Entry, Listbox, Buttons).
Algorithm: Input → Add/Delete/Complete → Update Listbox → Repeat.
4. Implementation:
Python with Tkinter.
Functions: add_task(), delete_task(), mark_complete().
Error handling via messagebox.showwarning.
5. Testing:
Add, delete, complete tasks tested individually and together.
Edge cases tested: empty input, no selection.
6. Deployment:
Run program using Python: python todo.py
User can now manage tasks in the GUI.
7. Maintenance:
Future improvements: Save tasks to file, add deadlines/priorities, enhance GUI.
